//      STEP 1 - Check Vim Ruby Support
//%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Check that your vim configuration has ruby support.  Type this in the
terminal:
    vim --version | grep ruby
The output should have something that has +ruby (if it has -ruby, you'll
need to install a vim version with ruby support)


If you need to install a vim version with ruby support, use the synaptic
package manager (In Ubuntu).  In the terminal, type:
    sudo apt-get install vim-nox

Once it has installed, use:
    vim --version | grep ruby
again and make sure that the output has +ruby in it.




//%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
//      STEP 2 - Install command-t
//%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Once your vim has ruby support, install by opening up command-t-1.4.vba in
vim using the following in the terminal
    vim command-t-1.4.vba


Source the vimball while in vim by the following into the vim command line
    :so %


Look at the output of the vimball extract to see what folder it extracted
everything to.  (The folder should be something like
~/.vim/bundle/vundle/command-t or something)


In the terminal type in
    cd <<the path of the folder where everything extracted to>>
    ruby extconf.rb
    make


Command-T should now be working!
